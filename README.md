## List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project



- Components: Core React building blocks. Gadget Haven likely includes multiple reusable components, such as ProductCard, Navbar, Footer, and FilterOptions.

- JSX (JavaScript XML): Allows mixing HTML with JavaScript. For Gadget Haven, JSX is likely used to structure the UI, like displaying product listings or building the search bar layout.

- Props: Passes data between components, essential for displaying product details and handling user inputs across Gadget Haven's component tree.

- State: Manages dynamic data that needs to update over time, such as search keywords, filter selections, and wishlist status for products.

- Event Handling: Handles user actions, like adding items to the wishlist, adjusting filters, and navigating pages.
